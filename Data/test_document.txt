Donald J. Trump faced a barrage of attacks from his Republican rivals during their debate Thursday night,
the last face-off before Super Tuesday next week.
Senator Marco Rubio assailed Mr. Trump’s record as a businessman and his knowledge of policy.
Senator Ted Cruz called him a closet liberal in a multitude of ways.
Mr. Trump responded forcefully and with a torrent of schoolyard taunts.
Many critics and commentators thought that Mr. Rubio was the clear winner on Thursday night,
but said that his newfound toughness may have come too late.

Rubio had a good night. He was good at challenging Trump, especially when he mocked him for repeating himself.
Turned the tables. Good to keep a smile through all Trump’s pushback.
I believe Rubio has more than recovered from the Christie takedown of earlier in February.”
— Ruth Sherman, a Connecticut-based public speaking expert.

Senator Marco Rubio, alarmed by Donald J.
Trump’s ascendancy and worried that his presidential chances were slipping away,
unleashed a barrage of attacks on the real estate mogul’s business ethics,
hiring practices and financial achievements in Thursday’s debate,
forcefully delivering the onslaught that Republican leaders had desperately awaited.

In a series of acid exchanges, a newly pugnacious Mr. Rubio, long mocked for a robotic and restrained style,
interrupted Mr. Trump, quizzed him, impersonated him, shouted over him and left him looking unsettled.
It was an unfamiliar reversal of roles for the front-runner, who found himself so frequently the target of assaults
from Mr. Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz that he complained they must have been a ploy for better television ratings.

pparently elephants aren't big fans of diplomacy.

At least that's what Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake discovered on a trip last week to learn more about wildlife trafficking. Flake and several other senators were on a trip to Mozambique , Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to see some of the effects of wildlife trafficking and poaching firsthand.

During one outing on the trip Flake's convoy was charged by a group of elephants.


Hundreds of thousands of animals like elephants and rhinos are killed by poachers every year as part of a multi-billion-dollar industry for people who believe their tusks and horn have medicinal powers, Flake and fellow Sen. Chris Coons wrote in an op-ed for CNN .

Flake said the U.S. should keep supporting countries who deal with ivory poaching from elephants and rhinos because the money could go to criminal organizations to fund conflicts in the region.

"I wish it were something we were able to do more about, and we should be able to," Secretary of State John Kerry said in response to Flake's comments at a Senate Foreign Relations hearing on Tuesday.

Flake is the Republican chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy and was accompanied on the trip by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Mississippi), Ben Cardin , (D-Maryland), Chris Coons (D-Delaware) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California).

Flake and Coons have introduced a bill nicknamed the END Wildlife Trafficking Act that would help the federal government work with and provide help to countries working to stop poaching and wildlife trafficking.

"During our visit to Kenya , we saw the devastating impact of wildlife trafficking on some of the most iconic animals in some of the most beautiful places on Earth," Coons and Flake wrote in the CNN op-ed.

"But the impact doesn't stop there," they continued. "The growth of this illegal industry threatens the stability of vulnerable ecosystems and local communities, the health of their economies, and security at home and around the world."

The Go Programming Language is the authoritative resource for any programmer who wants to learn Go. It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so you'll find it accessible whether you're most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.

The first chapter is a tutorial on the basic concepts of Go, introduced through programs for file I/O and text processing, simple graphics, and web clients and servers.

Early chapters cover the structural elements of Go programs: syntax, control flow, data types, and the organization of a program into packages, files, and functions. The examples illustrate many packages from the standard library and show how to create new ones of your own. Later chapters explain the package mechanism in more detail, and how to build, test, and maintain projects using the go tool.
The chapters on methods and interfaces introduce Go's unconventional approach to object-oriented programming, in which methods can be declared on any type and interfaces are implicitly satisfied. They explain the key principles of encapsulation, composition, and substitutability using realistic examples.
